# VexUF-Seth

## Overview

**Status: Deprecated**

The "Seth" device was used as a sensor board to communicate with a Raspberry Pi computer directly to provide sensor readings via the serial port. It was built on a custom Arduino-based board.

## Features

- Custom Arduino-based sensor board
- Communicates with Raspberry Pi via serial port
- Provides real-time sensor readings

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the Seth device to the Raspberry Pi via the serial port.
   - Ensure all sensors are properly connected to the Seth device.

2. **Software Setup:**
   - Upload the firmware to the Seth device using the Arduino IDE.
   - Configure the Raspberry Pi to read data from the serial port.

3. **Running the System:**
   - Power on both the Seth device and the Raspberry Pi.
   - Open a serial monitor on the Raspberry Pi to view sensor readings.

## Usage

The Seth device continuously sends sensor data to the Raspberry Pi via the serial port. Use a serial monitor or a custom script on the Raspberry Pi to process and display the sensor data.
