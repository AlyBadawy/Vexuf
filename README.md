## Overview

The VexUF series is a collection of versatile devices designed for a variety of applications, including data logging, device control, and remote communication. Each device in the series has unique capabilities tailored to different use cases.

## Devices

### Horus

**Status: Active**

The "Horus" device is designed to support both Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) and amateur radio operators in monitoring and managing various power sources and environmental conditions. It is engineered to enhance operational capabilities by ensuring real-time monitoring of critical parameters. 

Horus provides detailed insights into power supply statuses and environmental conditions, ensuring operational continuity and situational awareness. Additionally, the device logs data to an SD card for future retrieval and analysis. The VexUF:Horus supports communication with a computer or a stand-alone TNC, utilizing the APRS protocol to transmit vital information to remote locations. This ensures better coordination and response during emergencies and day-to-day operations for amateur radio enthusiasts.

You can find the firmware and detailed documentation for the Horus device in the [Horus folder](./horus).

### Seth

**Status: Deprecated**

The "Seth" device was used as a sensor board to communicate with a Raspberry Pi computer directly to give sensor readings via the serial port. It was built on a custom Arduino-based board. 

You can find the deprecated firmware and documentation for the Seth device in the [Seth folder](./seth).
